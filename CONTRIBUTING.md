Contributing
============

Introduction
---

The Stack is:
- Postgres, Ruby, GraphQL, React

This Projects runs Ruby as Backend and React as Frontend. Main contact is Stormy for both atm.
there is some leftover Rails code for adverts and the old Moderation in the Backoffice.

Project-Tickets
---

There is a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/LKaI6dWm/scritch-staging) for tickets and bug reports


Git-Handling
---

we use [git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html).

- master is stable release -> can be pushed to scritch.es
- dev is mainbranch -> can be pushed to scritch-staging.com
- feature/myfeature are usually the work branches try to sync those with tickets (if you push a small fix to dev it is ok)

Coding Style
---

Actually none yet. Use best practice from your own experience and what ruby, javascript use as default. Don't make up your own.
Single source of truth is Ruby, Javascript, React, GraphQL Documentation
