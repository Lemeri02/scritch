## **BASIC CONCEPTS**

**Q. What is Scritch?**

A. Scritch is nothing short of a complete, networked map of every MakeR to every Fursuit, tagged in associated Media of every Convention Edition. It is “THE place to go for everything Fursuit!”.

**Q. Why should I use Scritch?**

A. Scritch was designed from the ground up, by Fursuiters for Fursuiters. Its goal is to become the go-to place for Fursuit Convention Media, and more!

**Q. How do I use Scritch?**

A. Scritch has been designed to be as user-intuitive as possible, but for further guidance on how to use the Website, please refer to the Website User Guide and the related answers in this FAQ.

**Q. Why did you pre-populate so many Fursuits?**

A. Scritch needed to be functional on launch, with a complement of Fursuits essential for this to support tagging etc. Moreover, the sheer amount of Fursuits would have presented an insurmountable creation approval bottleneck if requested from scratch post-launch.

**Q. Can I use Scritch without owning a Fursuit?**

A. Scritch supports community involvement in the sharing of Fursuit Convention Media, regardless if users own the Fursuits themselves. It is a platform for Fursuiters to chronicle memories and for users in general to enjoy their content.

**Q. Who designed Pixel?**

A. Pixel was conceptualised by Ricotiger, who worked with Lezified to create the Scritch Mascot who welcomes you today!

**Q. I love what you have done, how can I do more?**

A. Scritch thrives on community awareness of the website itself, so the best way you can do more is to tell your friends and followers about it!

___
## **PRIVACY**

**Q. What if I don’t want my Media to be shared without crediting me?**

A. Users that upload Media to Scritch are presented with a confirmation pop-up which states the requirement of upload permission. If an upload is conducted and this is not true, there are steps that you can take to put this right:

1) Comment on the article, kindly informing the uploader that it was originally created by you. They can then edit this attribute by unchecking the "I captured this media" checkbox allowing entry of your Scritch Profile link or a custom text string, able to be linked to your URL.
2) Report the article by clicking the Report Flag and raising an Admin Ticket. This will be subject to a fair amount of due diligence to safeguard against system abuse, so please use this option as a very last resort.

**Q. How does Scritch sit in line with European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?**

A. GDPR builds on existing data protection law to strengthen the protection of individuals' personal data. Scritch sits outside of this regulation since:

1) By definition, Fursuit Detail is not Personal Data and in the context of the regulation, ‘Pseudonymised’ information that cannot be linked to an individual is not included.
2) Handling of actual Personal Data is in line with the Privacy Policy, noting that Service Providers (Stripe and Telegram) operate independently from Scritch in their handling of Personal Data.

**Q. Is my personal data at risk?**

A. Please see above. Scritch also uses the latest security protocols to safeguard against cyber attacks.

**Q. How can I trust Scritch with my Credit Card details?**


A. Please see above. Stripe is a Third Party Service Provider that processes payments independently and does not allow Scritch visibility of Credit Card information.

**Q. I'm being harassed, what can I do?**


A. User Profiles are able to toggle visibility of their Profile to other Profiles through the Block feature which:
1) Prevents visibility of either User's Media.
2) Prevents Blocked User from seeing Blocker's profile

If there is an issue that this action does not resolve, please contact Support to let us know.

___
## **LOGGING IN**

**Q. I can’t Login to Scritch, what am I doing wrong?**

A. 99% of the time this is due to Third Party Cookies being Blocked in your browser. Once unblocked and refreshed, the Telegram Login should function as intended. If this is still not the case, please Contact Support.

**Q. Your promotional material stated "Integrates with Twitter and Facebook". This is not true, what gives?**

A. Scritch had plans to provide the ability to handle Telegram, Twitter, and Facebook Logins, but Telegram is the only integrated platform on launch. There are plans to correct this.

___
## **CONTENT**

**Q. What are the Content Guidelines?**

A. Content Guidelines are in place to ensure that Scritch Users are not exposed to disturbing or NSFW imagery, whilst ensuring that the database hosts only Fursuit-related Media.

**Q. What are the Upload Guidelines?**

A. Upload Guidelines as detailed in the Website User Guide are in place to:
1) Ensure permission of upload has been met.
2) Minimise “samey” articles that would ‘water down’ the variety of content by advising against batch uploads of a single shoot where little changes occur article to article.
3) Maintain the correct Tagging System, optimising efficiency of finding of Media.

**Q. What file types does Scritch support in Media uploads?**

A. Scritch allows upload of any image type, including GIFs!

**Q. Someone uploaded Media that I created, what can I do?**

A. Users that upload Media to Scritch are presented with a confirmation pop-up which states the requirement of upload permission. If an upload is conducted and this is not true, there are steps that you can take to put this right:

1) Comment on the article, kindly informing the uploader that it was originally created by you. They can then edit this attribute by unchecking the "I captured this media" checkbox allowing entry of your Scritch Profile link or a custom text string, able to be linked to your URL.
2) Report the article by clicking the Report Flag and raising an Admin Ticket. This will be subject to a fair amount of due diligence to safeguard against system abuse, so please use this option as a very last resort.

**Q. What if I am exposed to disturbing or NSFW imagery?**

A. Scritch strives to provide a safe User browsing experience; however, imagery not in line with Content Guidelines may be flagged as a Report Ticket after it has been hosted. Users are therefore required to be over 18 in line with Scritch Terms of Use.

___
## **FURSUIT/MAKER ASSET OWNERSHIP**

**Q. What steps are taken to validate Asset Claims?**

A. On submission of an Asset Claim Request, this creates a Ticket in the Scritch’ Admin Pool. An agent will then check over the information provided by the Ticket and confidence check that the Asset does not already exist. Then, in rare cases may seek further clarification from the Telegram ID that initiated it directly.

**Q. When should I create a New Fursuit Asset?**

A. Creation of a Fursuit Asset should only be requested if:
1) There is not an existing Fursuit Asset on the Website that is yours.
2) Your Fursuit is known by another Name to an existing Fursuit Asset.

The aim of a Fursuit Asset is to be able to be Taggable by the Community, therefore duplication of the same Fursuit, regardless of a Partial alt. is not supported as a Creation Request because it then risks confusion by duplication.

**Q. What happens if I sell my suit?**

A. Please see above. However, if a sold Fursuit keeps its name, filtering of Media can be achieved, based on Convention appearance during each ownership period.

**Q. Can I create a duplicate profile to demarcate a previous owner and my ownership?**

A. Please see above. Duplicate profiles of the same Fursuit Asset will serve to confuse Community tagging and Media queries, so an approach that minimises this is best for everyone.

**Q. Someone has already claimed my suit, what do I do?**

A. Claimed Fursuits can be contested by clicking the “Contest Claim” button atop the Full Page View of the Fursuit Asset. This will generate a Support Ticket and an Admin will be in touch to resolve.

**Q. I am a retired Fursuit Maker, please remove my Studio.**

A. The most important Fursuit Asset data field, allowing find of Fursuit Assets is the Maker Data Field. With Fursuit Asset owners having a right to be able to be found, removal of Fursuit Studios is not permitted unless they hold no Fursuit Assets linked to them.

**Q. I'm sorry to report that the owner of this Asset is deceased, what happens to it now?**

A. In the event of the IRL owner of the Fursuit Asset passing away, the Fursuit Asset will be made unclaimable to prevent abuse through “Catfishing” (impersonation).

___
## **DATA FIELDS**

**Q. Why aren't Scritch fields open text?**

A. Scritch has been designed from the ground up with a strong emphasis on Data Validation. Custom text fields result in a database that becomes unusable through corruption and confusion of terms that vary in meaning to others.

**Q. Can I use Scritch for Fursuit Media not taken at a Convention?**

A. Yes! A Category field was designed into the Media Data Field set to allow exactly this.

**Q. I have an idea for a category, can I add to your list?**

A. Category suggestions are welcomed by raising of a Support Ticket - Suggestion. The Scritch News Telegram Channel will Poll users with a New Dropdown item for vote if Admin review results in a split decision. The Category dropdown needs to be kept concise enough to balance inclusiveness alongside not being so vast that it becomes unworkable.

**Q. Your Convention Database is missing Convention ####, can you add it?**

A. Scritch conducts a periodic review of existing Conventions, with a system to flag creation of a new Convention Edition as it approaches. However, new Conventions start up all the time and there are so many gatherings that a heads up is always appreciated. However, please see below for eligibility.

**Q. What constitutes a Convention?**

A. In order not to attract an unmanageable amount of Convention Assets, Scritch maintains a database that requires the Event to:
1) Have an actual Website.
2) Run for a duration of longer than 4 hours.
3) Have a confirmed and announced Venue and Date.
4) Not require a Login to see Event Information.

**Q. Why aren't Furmeets on your Database?**

A. Please see above. There are far too many cities across the world for every small get together to be listed in the Events Database on Scritch. However, there is a Furmeet Category tag created to allow upload of Media from Furmeets.

___
## **FURSUIT ATTRIBUTES**

**Q. My species isn't in your species list, what do I do?**

A. Scritch looks to provide total inclusiveness of all real life Species, alongside the provision of common Hybrids in this list, and even a Custom Hybrid field (because listing out every combination was impractical as a dropdown).

However, if a Fursuit Asset was not added prior to launch of your species, the species list will not contain it as an option. If it doesn’t fit into the Hybrid category, it will be added to the species dropdown. However, some species types need to be grouped based on subtle genus variants and sheer numbers.

Ultimately the species dropdown needs to be concise enough to allow your Fursuit to be found. Unavoidably this means that Scritch has had to group species such as: ***Deer, Birds, Insects, Dinosaurs etc.***

**Q. How do I determine my Fursuit Asset Base Colour?**

A. With a vibrant range of multi-coloured Fursuits, this was sometimes difficult to define on work up prior to launch, so a line was taken to assign Base Colour on:
1) Predominant colour over the body whole by percentage.
2) Cranium to nape colour (if (1) was unable to be determined).

Ultimately, the Base Colour of your Fursuit Asset is an important detail that allows search on the Scritch Fursuit Asset database. Assigning a colour that is not obvious to most may result in your Fursuit not being tagged.

**Q. My Fursuit has many colours, can I put Rainbow as a Base Colour?**

A. Please see above. Rainbow colouration has been reserved for those Fursuit Assets where they have clearly been designed to look as such through their markings. Scritch is keen for users not to muddy this attribute by using this option as a catchall, as otherwise it will become insignificant as a search filter.

**Q. How have you classified "Realistic" as a Style attribute option?**

A. Realistic is somewhat subjective, but a general rule of thumb is that Resin Eyes make the Fursuit Design more likely to be classed as “Realistic”. Scritch has provided the “Realistic Toony” option where the line is not easily able to be drawn based on how the Fursuit Asset looks.

**Q. What is the Field "Role" on my Fursuit for?**

A. Role is a Fursuit Asset attribute that allows recovery of your Fursuit from search filter. It has been put in place to allow groups of individuals to find others with similar interests. The “Fursuiter” catchall Role for a Fursuit Asset was created because “Not Applicable” as a term seemed fairly harsh in forcing an assessment of input into the community.

**Q. I'm prolific in a few "Roles", can I choose more than one?**

A. Unfortunately the nature of this attribute requires your most predominant or preferred Role to be assigned.

___
## **SEARCH QUERIES**

**Q. If I add more than one Fursuit to the Search Filter, what happens?**

A. Media is returned as results from Search Queries based on all filters applied. Fursuit Assets count as separate Filter items, so the following is true:
1) **Fursuit A** Filtered – Fursuit A is returned, no matter if they feature in media with multiple other Fursuit Assets tagged.
2) **Fursuit A** and **Fursuit B** are Filtered – Media is only returned if both Filtered Fursuit Assets feature in Media, no matter if they feature in media with multiple other Fursuit Assets tagged.

**Q. How does the Custom Hybrid Search work?**

A. Hybrids are returned based on the number of Species terms entered into the field, but each Species term must be present in the Fursuit Asset Custom Hybrid Attribute for the query to generate the Fursuit as a search result.

___
## **ADVERTISEMENTS**

**Q. What file types does Scritch support in Advertisement file uploads?**

A. Scritch allows upload of any image type, including GIFs!

**Q. Why is your Advertisement file size limit so lenient, at odds to other sites?**

A. Scritch designers were aware of the technical challenges with trying to design an Advertisement within a specified file size parameter. For this reason, the decision was taken to not limit the file size, bearing in mind of course that the time an Advert is exposed to a user is usually brief, so there is an urgency to communicate information as quickly as possible before the next screen refresh.

This has however been done for ease of creating an Advertisement and not to promote stringed/lengthy Advertisements, so Admins reserve the right to reject, should this approach be abused.

**Q. Why must Advertisement files be 300x90 pixels?**

A. This Advert size was chosen because it fits nicely with the Website Design of Scritch and has been used effectively in the past, allowing users to re-use existing Adverts on the Scritch platform.

However, Scritch is able to auto scale Advertisements provided that the dimension ratio is the same.

**Q. My Advertisement Impression amount is dropping more than I expect, why is this?**

A. Scritch allows Advertisers to toggle On and Off a collection of Advertisements, so review your toggles and consider growth in the Website Userbase as the impression count drops as a total, shared by all active Advertisements as viewed by the number of Users.

___
## **SPONSORSHIP**

**Q. What is a Free Trial?**

A. Scritch has provided a Free Trial to allow Sponsorship Perks to be explored by Users. It is a way for folks to try out the additional features of the Website, avoiding unawareness of the perks, should a Subscription be taken up in support of the Website.

**Q. What happens after Free Trial duration expiry?**

A. On expiry of the Free Trial, the User Profile reverts to standard access. All involvement and exercise of the Sponsorship perks are retained by Scritch, should the User choose to continue where they left off in a fresh Sponsorship.

**Q. Why do you charge for Sponsorship?**

A. Much like a Convention, the Sponsorship option of Scritch allows a little support to be given to the Website to allow development of New Services and Features.

However, Sponsorship Perks have been designed in a way such that core use of the Website is not placed behind a paywall i.e. Users are able to search and view any content, regardless of Sponsorship Status). But being able to follow Fursuit Assets and Makers etc to get notifications automatically and Favourite Media allows extra interaction of the Website, and more features are planned.

**Q. What are my benefits as a Sponsor?**

A. Currently as a Sponsor, Users are able to:
1) Follow User Accounts (Photographers) to see content that they upload.
2) Follow Fursuiters to see content that they are tagged in.
3) Favourite Media that is then held in their Personal Favourites Gallery.
4) Follow Fursuit Makers to be notified of newly created Fursuits that have them assigned as the Maker.
5) Get notified of commission status changes on Makers they follow.

**Q. What happens If I end my Sponsorship?**

A. If a Sponsorship is cancelled, the features remain in effect until the Sponsorship Expiry date, at which point the User Profile reverts back to standard access. All involvement and exercise of the Sponsorship perks are retained by Scritch, should the User choose to continue where they left off in a fresh Sponsorship.

___
## **ACCOUNTS**

**Q. How can I contest an Account Suspension?**

A. Account Suspensions are in place to safeguard the browsing experience of Scritch Users and avoid malicious corruption of Content Fields. If you have been suspended, your actions have been reviewed by a member of the Admin Team and you must wait it out.

**Q. Someone is claiming to be staff and is asking for my Personal Information, what should I do?**

A. Scritch Admins do not need to hold personal information about you. If a Report requires investigation, evidence will be provided by the Admin that legitimises their reason for contacting you.

___
## **SUPPORT**

**Q. I want to become an Admin, what do I do?**

A. Admin rights are reserved for trusted individuals that have the best interests of Scritch at heart. The User Involvement Metrics allow highlight by Scritch of those individuals that have shown themselves to be prolific in their use of the Website. Such Users may be offered the ability to join the Admin Team periodically.

**Q. Where can I contact a Scritch admin?**

A. Scritch Admins are able to be contacted only via Report/Support Tickets. If there is further clarification required, they will contact you directly to progress Tickets to close out.

**Q. How are reports handled?**

A. Report Tickets are handled by assignment of an Admin agent from Scritch’ Back Office. Each report will be given the appropriate amount of due diligence to effect close.

**Q. How long am I expected to wait for resolution of a support request?**

A. Ticket processing is simply based on the number of available agents against the volume of Tickets to be handled. There will be periods of delays brought about by marketing pushes etc, but the approach is to handle all Tickets as soon as possible. Users can assist with the expedience of the Admin Ticket handling time by only submitting a Report Ticket as a last resort e.g. if something is amiss, inform the User Profile by commenting on their Media (they may not be aware that what they have done is wrong and the issue could be resolved without involving the Admin Team).

**Q. I found a bug on the website, how do I let you know?**

A. Our exterminators are on hand to deal with Bugs in the Website code as a priority. As such, clicking Contact Support from the Support menu of the Website header and selecting “Technical” as a Category will direct it to the right people fast.

___
## **INVOLVEMENT METRICS**

**Q. Why am I an Aardvark in the Website Header, I clearly am a Tiger by Fursuit!?**

A. Profile Species is driven by User Involvement and is calculated as detailed in the Website User Guide. The system automates a Species based on the number of Involvement Points earned by all Users on the Website, against the Number of Species in the Species List and assigns that species based on the Point Block that the User resides in at their current Involvement Score.

**Q. Why does Scritch have an Involvement Metric?**

A. Scritch maintains an Involvement Score to inspire competitive use of the Website alongside being able to spotlight those prolific “Scritchers” that may be extended an offer to become an Admin.

**Q. How do my actions affect my Profile Involvement Score?**

A. Involvement Score is detailed in the Website User Guide, which tabulates all Website Actions and what they equate to as a Score + or -.

___
## **FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS**

**Q. What future developments are in the works?**

A. One Future Development that Scritch has planned is a Future Developments page! So stay tuned for that!

**Q. Can I suggest an idea for a new Feature?**
