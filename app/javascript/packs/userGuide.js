#### **Involvement Monitoring**
Involvement of every user is tracked through discrete algorithms that allow periodic review of the Website Owners to amend User Levels accordingly.
#### Involvement Action Weighting
User Involvement Actions are weighted in line with the points system below. If an Account Owns multiple Fursuits, points weighted against actions related to each Fursuit will aggregate to a total points score for the Account itself.
| Action | Effect | Points |
| :------ | :------: | :------: |
| **Upload Media** | **Positive** | **1** |
| **Comment** | **Positive** | **1** |
| **Tag** | **Positive** | **1** |
| **Invalidated Tag** | Negative | -10 |
| **Give a Scritch** | **Positive** | 1 |
| **Give a Favourite** | **Positive** | 1 |
| **Give a Follow** | **Positive** | 1 |

***Example 1***
> Total Number of Users: 750
> Total Number of Species: 180
**750 / 180 = 4.17** (Rounded Down to 4)
Equates to a User Species Block value of **4**. Allowing a top heavy top user species by addressing the decimal:
**4 x 179 = 716** (Everything Above **716** Top User Block) = **34 Zebras**

***Example 2***
> Total Number of Users: 17560
> Total Number of Species: 240
**17560 / 240 = 73.17** (Rounded Down to 73)
Equates to a User Species Block value of **73**. Allowing a top heavy top user species by addressing the decimal:
